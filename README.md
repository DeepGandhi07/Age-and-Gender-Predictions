# Age-and-Gender-Predictions
Age and Gender Prediction I created this using Libraries which are pandas, numpy, matplotlib
, keras, tensorflow, scikit-learn.This project consists both classification and regression. A CNN model which is Neural Network it will predict the age and gender using the facial image of the person. I got my Gender Accuracy around 90 and Age Mean Absolute Error is 6.5. A Dataset which is used in this project is taken from Kaggle which contains a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity.
